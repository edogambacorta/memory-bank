# Product Context: AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare

## Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations, particularly hospitals, face significant challenges in efficiently processing and analyzing large volumes of patient-related PDF documents. Manual processing is time-consuming, error-prone, and often fails to extract valuable insights from these documents while maintaining compliance with strict data protection regulations.

## Solution
Our AI-powered PDF processing system addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced language models to automate and enhance document analysis. The solution is developed in two phases:

1. MVP: A locally hosted system for a hospital secretary to efficiently process patient documents.
2. Scaled Solution: An AWS-hosted LLM system for intelligent PDF processing across multiple industries.

## Target Users

### MVP Phase
- Hospital secretaries dealing with patient-related PDF documents

### Scaled Solution Phase
Organizations dealing with large volumes of PDF documents, including but not limited to:
- Healthcare institutions
- Legal firms
- Financial institutions
- Research organizations
- Government agencies
- Large enterprises with extensive documentation
