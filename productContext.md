# Product Context: AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare

## Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations, particularly hospitals, face significant challenges in efficiently processing and analyzing large volumes of patient-related PDF documents. Manual processing is time-consuming, error-prone, and often fails to extract valuable insights from these documents while maintaining compliance with strict data protection regulations.

## Solution
Our AI-powered PDF processing system addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced language models to automate and enhance document analysis. The solution is developed in three phases:

1. Initial MVP (Deepseek RAG App): An AWS-hosted LLM chatbot for processing 80-page PDF documents.
2. Extended MVP: A locally hosted system for a hospital secretary to efficiently process patient documents.
3. Scaled Solution: An expanded AWS-hosted LLM system for intelligent PDF processing across multiple industries.

## Target Users
