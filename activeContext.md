# Active Context: AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare

## Current Focus
Our current focus is on implementing the initial MVP (Deepseek RAG App) to process 80-page PDF documents using a locally hosted LLM chatbot on AWS Zurich servers. This serves as the foundation for our broader project goals in healthcare document processing.

## Recent Changes
- Project scope refined to start with the Deepseek RAG App as the initial MVP
- Shift to AWS-based deployment for the initial MVP using G6.xlarge EC2 instance
- Implementation of Ollama with DeepSeek R1/8B model for the initial MVP
- Creation of initialMVP.md to document the Deepseek RAG App implementation plan

## Next Steps
1. Set up AWS EC2 instance (G6.xlarge) in Zurich region
   - Launch and configure the instance according to the initialMVP.md specifications

2. Implement Nginx reverse proxy and secure with HTTPS
   - Set up Nginx for routing traffic to Streamlit app and Ollama API
   - Obtain and configure SSL certificate for secure communication

3. Set up the Deepseek-RAG-App repository
   - Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies
   - Configure the Python environment and required libraries

4. Install and configure Ollama with DeepSeek R1/8B model
   - Set up Ollama and download the specified model
   - Ensure proper integration with the Streamlit application

5. Develop and test the Streamlit application
   - Implement the user interface for PDF upload and question answering
   - Ensure smooth interaction between the UI, Ollama, and the LLM

6. Optimize and test the system
   - Ensure efficient processing of 80-page PDF documents
   - Conduct thorough testing of the chatbot's question-answering capabilities

7. Plan for future phases
   - Outline the transition from the initial MVP to the extended MVP for hospital secretaries
   - Identify key steps for scaling to a comprehensive AWS-based solution

## Active Decisions
1. Implementing the Deepseek RAG App as the initial MVP
   - Rationale: Provides a solid foundation for PDF processing and LLM integration
   - Impact: Accelerates development and allows for early testing of core functionalities

2. Utilizing AWS EC2 (G6.xlarge) for the initial MVP
   - Rationale: Offers necessary GPU capabilities for efficient LLM processing
   - Impact: Ensures performance for handling 80-page PDF documents

3. Using Ollama with DeepSeek R1/8B model
   - Rationale: Provides a powerful, open-source LLM solution
   - Impact: Enables advanced document analysis and question-answering capabilities

4. Implementing Streamlit for the user interface
   - Rationale: Allows for rapid development of a user-friendly interface
   - Impact: Facilitates easy interaction with the PDF processing and chatbot features

## Ongoing Considerations
- Ensuring the initial MVP meets performance requirements for processing 80-page PDFs
- Planning the transition from the Deepseek RAG App to a more specialized solution for hospital secretaries
- Evaluating the scalability of the current architecture for future expansion
- Considering future integration of Swiss data protection laws for the extended MVP
- Gathering user feedback from the initial MVP to inform the development of subsequent phases
- Monitoring AWS resource usage and optimizing for cost-effectiveness
- Keeping abreast of developments in LLM technology, particularly the progress of Mistral-OCR

This active context will be regularly updated as we progress through the implementation of our initial MVP (Deepseek RAG App) and plan for subsequent phases of our AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare.
