# Active Context: AWS-based Large PDF Processing System

## Current Focus
Our current focus is on setting up the AWS infrastructure and integrating Ollama with the DeepSeek R1/8B model for our PDF processing system.

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup completed
- Technology stack selected: AWS, Ollama, DeepSeek R1/8B

## Next Steps
1. Implement PDF parsing and text extraction
   - Research and select appropriate PDF parsing libraries
   - Develop functions for efficient text extraction from PDFs

2. Set up Ollama on AWS EC2 instances
   - Configure EC2 instances optimized for LLM processing
   - Install and configure Ollama on the instances

3. Integrate DeepSeek R1/8B model
   - Download and set up DeepSeek R1/8B model with Ollama
   - Develop integration scripts for model inference

4. Develop initial processing pipeline
   - Create workflow for PDF upload, processing, and result storage
   - Implement basic error handling and logging

## Active Decisions
1. Choosing Zurich-based AWS infrastructure
   - Rationale: Ensure data locality and compliance with European regulations
   - Impact: May affect latency for non-European users, but prioritizes data protection

2. Selecting Ollama and DeepSeek R1/8B as initial technologies
   - Rationale: Ollama provides flexibility in model management, DeepSeek R1/8B offers good performance for our initial requirements
   - Impact: Sets the foundation for our system, with a clear upgrade path to Mistral-OCR in the future

## Ongoing Considerations
- Monitoring system performance and resource utilization
- Evaluating the need for additional AWS services as the project progresses
- Planning for the future integration of Mistral-OCR
- Ensuring scalability of the solution as processing demands increase

This active context will be regularly updated as we progress through the development and implementation phases of our AWS-based Large PDF Processing System.
