# Active Context: AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare

## Current Focus
Our current focus is on developing an MVP for a hospital secretary to efficiently process patient-related PDF documents, with a plan to scale to an AWS-based solution in the future.

## Recent Changes
- Project scope redefined to start with an MVP for healthcare
- Initial focus on local deployment for a single user (hospital secretary)
- Emphasis on compliance with Swiss data protection laws, including FADP

## Next Steps
1. Define specific MVP features for hospital secretary use case
   - Identify key document types and processing requirements
   - Outline user interface and workflow for the MVP

2. Implement PDF parsing and text extraction for the MVP
   - Research and select appropriate PDF parsing libraries for local deployment
   - Develop functions for efficient text extraction from patient-related PDFs

3. Select and integrate a suitable LLM for the MVP
   - Evaluate LLMs that can run efficiently on a standard PC
   - Implement the chosen LLM for document analysis and information extraction

4. Develop initial processing pipeline for the MVP
   - Create workflow for PDF upload, processing, and result storage on a local system
   - Implement basic error handling and logging
   - Ensure compliance with Swiss data protection laws in all processes

5. Plan for future AWS integration and scaling
   - Outline the transition from local MVP to AWS-based solution
   - Identify key AWS services for future implementation (e.g., EC2, S3, Lambda)

## Active Decisions
1. Starting with a locally hosted MVP for a hospital secretary
   - Rationale: Allows for faster development and testing in a specific use case
   - Impact: Provides immediate value to healthcare sector while laying groundwork for future scaling

2. Focusing on compliance with Swiss data protection laws
   - Rationale: Ensures the system meets stringent healthcare data security requirements
   - Impact: Builds trust and reliability, setting a strong foundation for expansion

3. Planning for future AWS integration and use of advanced LLMs
   - Rationale: Prepares for scalability and performance improvements
   - Impact: Enables smooth transition from MVP to a comprehensive, multi-industry solution

## Ongoing Considerations
- Balancing MVP functionality with the need for a quickly deployable solution
- Ensuring the local system's performance meets the hospital secretary's needs
- Planning the transition from local deployment to AWS infrastructure
- Evaluating potential LLMs for both MVP and future scaled solution (including DeepSeek R1/8B and Mistral-OCR)
- Monitoring regulatory changes in Swiss data protection laws
- Gathering user feedback from the MVP to inform future development

This active context will be regularly updated as we progress through the development of our MVP and plan for the scaled, AWS-based PDF Processing System.
