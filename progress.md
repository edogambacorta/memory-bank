# Progress: AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare

## Completed
- Initial project planning and scope definition
- Project redefinition:
  - Shifted focus to an MVP for a hospital secretary
  - Planned transition to a scaled AWS-based solution
- Creation and update of project documentation:
  - Project brief
  - Product context
  - Active context
  - System architecture and patterns
  - Technical context
- Basic PDF processing setup:
  - Created 'processed' folder in pdf_processing directory
  - Implemented process_pdf.py for moving, logging, and summarizing PDFs
  - Implemented backup_processed.py for creating backups of processed PDFs

## In Progress
- Defining specific MVP features for hospital secretary use case
- Researching appropriate technologies for the MVP:
  - Programming language and GUI framework for local application
  - Suitable LLM for local deployment
  - PDF processing libraries for efficient text extraction
- Planning the transition from MVP to AWS-based scaled solution

## To Do

### MVP Phase
1. Finalize MVP feature set
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to define essential features for hospital secretary

2. Select and set up development environment
   - Choose programming language, GUI framework, and IDE
   - Set up version control with Git

3. Implement local PDF processing pipeline
   - Develop functions for PDF upload, text extraction, and analysis
   - Integrate selected local LLM for document processing

4. Create user interface for document upload and result presentation
   - Design and implement a desktop application interface
   - Ensure intuitive workflow for hospital secretary use

5. Implement local security measures
   - Set up local encryption for stored PDFs and results
   - Implement user authentication and access controls

6. Conduct thorough testing
   - Perform unit testing of individual components
   - Conduct integration testing of the entire local pipeline
   - User acceptance testing with hospital secretaries

7. Optimize performance for local deployment
   - Ensure efficient processing on standard PC hardware
   - Optimize LLM inference speed for local use

8. Prepare documentation and training materials
   - Create user manual for hospital secretaries
   - Develop training program for system usage

### Scaled Solution Phase (Future)
1. Set up AWS infrastructure:
   - Configure EC2 instances for Ollama and LLM hosting
   - Set up S3 buckets for PDF storage and result management
   - Implement Lambda functions for workflow orchestration
   - Configure SQS for job queue management

2. Migrate and enhance PDF processing pipeline
   - Adapt local processing pipeline to AWS environment
   - Integrate with DeepSeek R1/8B or other selected model for advanced analysis

3. Implement expanded security measures
   - Set up VPC for network isolation
   - Configure IAM roles for secure service interactions
   - Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest

4. Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Configure CloudWatch dashboards for system overview
   - Implement custom metrics for PDF processing
   - Set up alerting for abnormal system behavior

5. Optimize cloud performance
   - Fine-tune EC2 instance configurations
   - Optimize Lambda functions for faster execution
   - Improve model inference speed in cloud environment

6. Prepare for Mistral-OCR integration
   - Monitor Mistral-OCR development and release
   - Plan integration strategy
   - Develop upgrade path from initial model to Mistral-OCR

## Known Issues
- None at this stage (project in redefinition and MVP planning phase)

## How to Use the Current Setup

1. Process a PDF:
   - Place the PDF file in the `pdf_processing/input` folder
   - Run the following command from the project root:
     ```
     python pdf_processing/process_pdf.py <filename.pdf>
     ```
   - The processed file will be moved to `pdf_processing/processed` with a version number if necessary
   - A summary JSON file will be created alongside the processed PDF
   - Processing details will be logged in `pdf_processing/processing_log.txt`

2. Create a backup:
   - Run the following command from the project root:
     ```
     python pdf_processing/backup_processed.py
     ```
   - This will create a timestamped backup of the `processed` folder in `pdf_processing/backup`

Note: The current setup will be significantly modified as we develop the MVP for the hospital secretary use case. Updates to the usage instructions will be provided as the new system is implemented.

This progress report will be regularly updated as we advance through the development of our MVP and plan for the scaled, AWS-based PDF Processing System.
