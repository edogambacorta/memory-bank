# Progress: AWS-based Large PDF Processing System

## Completed
- Initial project planning and scope definition
- Technology stack selection:
  - AWS as the cloud infrastructure provider
  - Ollama for model management and inference
  - DeepSeek R1/8B as the initial LLM model
- Creation of project documentation:
  - Project brief
  - Product context
  - System architecture and patterns
  - Technical context
- Basic PDF processing setup:
  - Created 'processed' folder in pdf_processing directory
  - Implemented process_pdf.py for moving, logging, and summarizing PDFs
  - Implemented backup_processed.py for creating backups of processed PDFs

## In Progress
- Setting up AWS infrastructure:
  - Configuring EC2 instances for Ollama and LLM hosting
  - Setting up S3 buckets for PDF storage and result management
  - Implementing Lambda functions for workflow orchestration
  - Configuring SQS for job queue management
- Implementing Ollama on EC2 instances

## To Do
1. Integrate DeepSeek R1/8B model
   - Download and set up the model with Ollama
   - Develop integration scripts for model inference

2. Enhance PDF processing pipeline
   - Integrate with DeepSeek R1/8B for text analysis
   - Implement more advanced text extraction and analysis functions

3. Create user interface for document upload and result presentation
   - Design and implement a web-based frontend for user interactions
   - Develop API endpoints for frontend-backend communication

4. Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Configure CloudWatch dashboards for system overview
   - Implement custom metrics for PDF processing
   - Set up alerting for abnormal system behavior

5. Conduct thorough testing
   - Perform unit testing of individual components
   - Conduct integration testing of the entire pipeline
   - Stress test the system with large volumes of PDFs

6. Optimize performance
   - Fine-tune EC2 instance configurations
   - Optimize Lambda functions for faster execution
   - Improve model inference speed

7. Implement security measures
   - Set up VPC for network isolation
   - Configure IAM roles for secure service interactions
   - Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest

8. Prepare for Mistral-OCR integration
   - Monitor Mistral-OCR development and release
   - Plan integration strategy
   - Develop upgrade path from DeepSeek R1/8B to Mistral-OCR

## Known Issues
- None at this stage (project in initial setup phase)

## How to Use the Current Setup

1. Process a PDF:
   - Place the PDF file in the `pdf_processing/input` folder
   - Run the following command from the project root:
     ```
     python pdf_processing/process_pdf.py <filename.pdf>
     ```
   - The processed file will be moved to `pdf_processing/processed` with a version number if necessary
   - A summary JSON file will be created alongside the processed PDF
   - Processing details will be logged in `pdf_processing/processing_log.txt`

2. Create a backup:
   - Run the following command from the project root:
     ```
     python pdf_processing/backup_processed.py
     ```
   - This will create a timestamped backup of the `processed` folder in `pdf_processing/backup`

This progress report will be regularly updated as we advance through the development and implementation phases of our AWS-based Large PDF Processing System.
