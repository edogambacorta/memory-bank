# Progress: AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare

## Completed
- Initial project planning and scope definition
- Project redefinition:
  - Shifted focus to an initial MVP (Deepseek RAG App) for PDF processing
  - Planned phased approach: initial MVP, extended MVP for hospital secretary, and scaled AWS-based solution
- Creation and update of project documentation:
  - Project brief
  - Product context
  - Active context
  - System architecture and patterns
  - Technical context
  - Initial MVP (Deepseek RAG App) implementation plan
- Basic PDF processing setup (to be replaced by Deepseek RAG App):
  - Created 'processed' folder in pdf_processing directory
  - Implemented process_pdf.py for moving, logging, and summarizing PDFs
  - Implemented backup_processed.py for creating backups of processed PDFs

## In Progress
- Setting up development environment for Deepseek RAG App implementation
- Researching and confirming AWS EC2 G6.xlarge instance specifications for Zurich region
- Preparing for AWS infrastructure setup (EC2, Nginx, SSL)
- Reviewing Ollama and DeepSeek R1/8B model integration requirements

## To Do

### Initial MVP Phase (Deepseek RAG App)
1. Set up AWS EC2 instance (G6.xlarge) in Zurich region
   - Launch and configure the instance according to the initialMVP.md specifications

2. Implement Nginx reverse proxy and secure with HTTPS
   - Set up Nginx for routing traffic to Streamlit app and Ollama API
   - Obtain and configure SSL certificate for secure communication

3. Set up the Deepseek-RAG-App repository
   - Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies
   - Configure the Python environment and required libraries

4. Install and configure Ollama with DeepSeek R1/8B model
   - Set up Ollama and download the specified model
   - Ensure proper integration with the Streamlit application

5. Develop and test the Streamlit application
   - Implement the user interface for PDF upload and question answering
   - Ensure smooth interaction between the UI, Ollama, and the LLM

6. Optimize and test the system
   - Ensure efficient processing of 80-page PDF documents
   - Conduct thorough testing of the chatbot's question-answering capabilities

7. Prepare documentation and deployment instructions
   - Create user manual for the Deepseek RAG App
   - Document the deployment process and system architecture

### Extended MVP Phase (Hospital Secretary Use Case)
1. Analyze Deepseek RAG App performance and gather user feedback
2. Identify additional features required for hospital secretary use case
3. Enhance PDF processing capabilities for patient-related documents
4. Implement local deployment option for standard PC hardware
5. Integrate compliance measures for Swiss data protection laws

### Scaled Solution Phase (Future)
1. Expand AWS infrastructure:
   - Scale EC2 instances for multi-user support
   - Implement auto-scaling and load balancing
   - Set up S3 buckets for large-scale PDF storage and result management

2. Enhance PDF processing pipeline
   - Optimize for larger document volumes and diverse document types
   - Integrate advanced features for multi-industry support

3. Implement expanded security measures
   - Set up VPC for network isolation
   - Configure IAM roles for secure service interactions
   - Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest

4. Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
   - Configure CloudWatch dashboards for system overview
   - Implement custom metrics for PDF processing
   - Set up alerting for abnormal system behavior

5. Optimize cloud performance
   - Fine-tune EC2 instance configurations
   - Implement caching mechanisms for improved response times
   - Optimize model inference speed in cloud environment

6. Prepare for Mistral-OCR integration
   - Monitor Mistral-OCR development and release
   - Plan integration strategy
   - Develop upgrade path from DeepSeek R1/8B to Mistral-OCR

## Known Issues
- None at this stage (project in initial MVP implementation phase)

## How to Use the Current Setup

Note: The current setup is in transition as we implement the Deepseek RAG App as our initial MVP. The following instructions will be updated once the new system is deployed:

1. Access the Deepseek RAG App:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the application URL (to be provided upon deployment)
   - Upload an 80-page PDF document using the provided interface
   - Interact with the chatbot by asking questions about the uploaded document

2. For Developers:
   - Clone the Deepseek-RAG-App repository
   - Follow the setup instructions in initialMVP.md for local development and testing

This progress report will be regularly updated as we advance through the implementation of our initial MVP (Deepseek RAG App) and subsequent phases of our AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare.
