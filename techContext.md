# Technical Context: AWS-based Large PDF Processing System

## AWS Services
- EC2: For hosting Ollama and LLM models
- S3: For storing input PDFs and processed results
- Lambda: For workflow orchestration and triggering processing tasks
- SQS: For managing processing jobs and ensuring scalability
- CloudWatch: For monitoring, logging, and alerting

## LLM Technologies
- Ollama: For model management and inference
- DeepSeek R1/8B: Initial model for PDF processing
- Future upgrade path: Mistral-OCR (when available)

## Development Setup
- AWS CLI and SDK: For interacting with AWS services
- Python: Primary language for Lambda functions and processing scripts
- Docker: For Ollama deployment and potential containerization of processing pipeline

## PDF Processing Libraries
- To be determined: Research needed to select appropriate libraries for efficient text extraction from PDFs

## Technical Constraints
- Zurich-based AWS infrastructure requirement: Ensures data locality and compliance with European regulations
- Large PDF handling capabilities: System must efficiently process and analyze documents of significant size
- Scalability considerations: Architecture must support increasing processing demands

## Performance Considerations
- GPU-optimized EC2 instances: For efficient model inference
- S3 Transfer Acceleration: For faster uploads of large PDFs from distant locations
- SQS FIFO queues: For maintaining processing order when necessary

## Security Measures
- VPC: For network isolation of EC2 instances
- IAM roles: For secure, key-less authentication between AWS services
- Encryption: In-transit (HTTPS) and at-rest (S3 encryption) for all data

## Monitoring and Logging
- CloudWatch Logs: For centralized log management
- CloudWatch Dashboards: For real-time system overview
- Custom metrics: For tracking PDF processing times and success rates

This technical context provides an overview of the technologies, services, and considerations that form the foundation of our AWS-based Large PDF Processing System. It will be updated as the project progresses and new technical decisions are made.
