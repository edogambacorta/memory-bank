# Technical Context: AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare

## MVP Phase Technologies

### Local Application
- Programming Language: To be determined (e.g., Python, Java, or C#)
- GUI Framework: To be determined (e.g., PyQt, JavaFX, or WPF)
- PDF Processing Libraries: To be researched (e.g., PyPDF2, iText, or PDFBox)

### Local LLM
- To be determined: Research needed to select an appropriate LLM that can run efficiently on a standard PC
- Potential options: Smaller versions of open-source models like BERT, GPT-2, or specialized medical NLP models

### Development Setup
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): To be determined
- Version Control: Git
- Build and Dependency Management: To be determined based on chosen programming language

### Security Measures
- Local encryption: For securing stored PDFs and processed results
- Access controls: To ensure only authorized users can access the application and data

## Scaled Solution Phase Technologies

### AWS Services
- EC2: For hosting Ollama and LLM models
- S3: For storing input PDFs and processed results
- Lambda: For workflow orchestration and triggering processing tasks
- SQS: For managing processing jobs and ensuring scalability
- CloudWatch: For monitoring, logging, and alerting

### LLM Technologies
- Ollama: For model management and inference
- DeepSeek R1/8B: Initial model for PDF processing
- Future upgrade path: Mistral-OCR (when available)

### Development Setup
- AWS CLI and SDK: For interacting with AWS services
- Python: Primary language for Lambda functions and processing scripts
- Docker: For Ollama deployment and potential containerization of processing pipeline

### PDF Processing Libraries
- To be determined: Research needed to select appropriate libraries for efficient text extraction from PDFs

## Technical Constraints

### MVP Phase
- Standard PC hardware: System must run efficiently on typical hospital workstations
- Offline capability: Application should function without constant internet connectivity
- Data protection: Must comply with Swiss data protection laws, including FADP

### Scaled Solution Phase
- Zurich-based AWS infrastructure: Ensures data locality and compliance with Swiss and European regulations
- Large PDF handling capabilities: System must efficiently process and analyze documents of significant size
- Scalability considerations: Architecture must support increasing processing demands across multiple industries

## Performance Considerations

### MVP Phase
- Optimize local LLM for speed and efficiency on standard hardware
- Implement efficient PDF parsing and text extraction methods
- Design user interface for quick and intuitive interactions

### Scaled Solution Phase
- GPU-optimized EC2 instances: For efficient model inference
- S3 Transfer Acceleration: For faster uploads of large PDFs from distant locations
- SQS FIFO queues: For maintaining processing order when necessary

## Security Measures

### MVP Phase
- Local data encryption: Protect stored PDFs and processed results
- Secure user authentication: Ensure only authorized personnel can access the system
- Regular security updates: Keep the application and its dependencies up-to-date

### Scaled Solution Phase
- VPC: For network isolation of EC2 instances
- IAM roles: For secure, key-less authentication between AWS services
- Encryption: In-transit (HTTPS) and at-rest (S3 encryption) for all data

## Monitoring and Logging

### MVP Phase
- Local logging: Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and auditing
- Performance monitoring: Track processing times and system resource usage

### Scaled Solution Phase
- CloudWatch Logs: For centralized log management
- CloudWatch Dashboards: For real-time system overview
- Custom metrics: For tracking PDF processing times and success rates

This technical context provides an overview of the technologies, services, and considerations that form the foundation of our AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare, starting with the MVP and evolving into a scaled AWS-based solution. It will be updated as the project progresses and new technical decisions are made.

[Note: Specific technology choices for the MVP phase will be finalized once more details about the required features are provided.]
