# Project Brief: AWS-based Large PDF Processing System

## Project Goal
Implement an AWS-based system for processing large PDF documents using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Key Requirements

1. Utilize Zurich-based AWS infrastructure
2. Implement Ollama for general running of models
3. Start with DeepSeek R1/8B model, with plans to upgrade to Mistral-OCR when available
4. Focus on efficient processing of large PDF documents
5. Ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness

## Objectives

1. Develop a robust PDF processing pipeline
2. Integrate LLM capabilities for intelligent document analysis
3. Implement scalable AWS infrastructure
4. Ensure high performance and accuracy in document processing
5. Provide an easy-to-use interface for document upload and result retrieval

This project aims to revolutionize the way large PDF documents are processed and analyzed, leveraging the power of AWS cloud infrastructure and state-of-the-art language models.
