# Project Brief: AI-Powered PDF Processing System for Healthcare

## Project Goal
Develop an AI-powered system for processing large PDF documents, starting with an MVP for a hospital secretary and scaling to a comprehensive AWS-based solution.

## Key Requirements

1. MVP Phase:
   a. Develop a locally hosted solution for a single user (hospital secretary)
   b. Focus on efficient processing of patient-related PDF documents
   c. Ensure compliance with Swiss data protection laws, including FADP
   d. Implement on a standard personal computer

2. Scaled Solution Phase:
   a. Utilize Zurich-based AWS infrastructure
   b. Implement Ollama for general running of models
   c. Start with DeepSeek R1/8B model, with plans to upgrade to Mistral-OCR when available
   d. Ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness

## Objectives

1. MVP Phase:
   a. Develop a robust PDF processing pipeline for patient documents
   b. Integrate LLM capabilities for intelligent document analysis
   c. Ensure high performance and accuracy in document processing
   d. Provide an easy-to-use interface for document processing and result retrieval
   e. Implement necessary security measures to comply with Swiss data protection laws

2. Scaled Solution Phase:
   a. Transition the MVP to a scalable AWS infrastructure
   b. Expand the system to handle multiple users and larger document volumes
   c. Implement advanced features for diverse document types and industries
   d. Optimize for cost-effectiveness and performance at scale

This project aims to revolutionize the way large PDF documents are processed and analyzed in healthcare settings, with the potential to expand to other industries. It will leverage the power of AI and cloud infrastructure while maintaining strict compliance with data protection regulations.
